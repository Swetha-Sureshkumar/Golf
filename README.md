Problem(golf): There are n balls, n holes and n players on the golf field. Each player wants to put one ball to a hole and they want to do it simultaneously and each player chooses a different hole. Assume that the balls and the holes are points on the plain and that none three of them are colinear and that the balls move in the straight lines. Present an algorithm running in time O(n^2 Â· log n) which assigns the balls to the holes so that no two tracks of the balls intersect.
